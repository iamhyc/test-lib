# Test Library

my practice base for code snippet reuse and sharing; unlike gist, it's for fast demo with direct results.

[TOC]

## 01 Raw Socket Relay

A practice on raw_socket transmission on receiving, to demo relay mechanism

## 02 Serial Test

python and unix version serial transmission example

## 03 Timing Resolution Test

providing timing mechanism for both userspace and kernelspace

## 04 Debugfs/Procfs with mmap operation

(now only with) procfs example, use mmap to avoid extra memory copy, between userspace and kernelspace.
